Get the Best In Show dataset

```{r}
BIS<-readxl::read_xlsx('KIB.xlsx', sheet='Best in show')
head(BIS,10)
```

```{r}
BIS <- BIS %>%  select(c(1,3,5,7,9,10,12))

head(BIS,10)

```
Had to show the first 10 rows because there was so much garbge data in it. Looks like the first few rows aren't needed and there's extra uncessary columns. Let's get rid of that.

```{r}
BIS <- BIS[4:nrow(BIS),]
head(BIS,10)


```

```

BISFULL<-readxl::read_xlsx('KIB.xlsx', sheet='Best in show full sheet')
head 
```
